Human history is old -- like, really, really old. Literally thousands of years old. That may not be all that long on a geological or evolutionary scale, but considering people usually don't even make it into triple digits age-wise (or past 60, if you have an understandable love of deep-fried bacon twinkies), it's pretty long for us. Given that so many things have happened, it stands to reason that there would be no shortage of legendary, recognizable historical figures. But do you know what Albert Einstein, the creator of the Theory of General Relativity, looked like? How about Abraham Lincoln, the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation? Or Queen Victoria, the long-reigning British monarch so famous an entire era is named after her? Or Thomas Edison, the Wizard of Menlo Park? How about Charles Darwin, who came up with the theory of natural selection and jumpstarted evolutionary theory in the process?
